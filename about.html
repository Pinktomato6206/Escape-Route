            <h1>HI! My name is Adriane Rhon Alberto, and this is the second website that I made.</h1><p>I admit, the first one sucked. It was called The Mirrorball, featuring memes, music, and my favorite artists/bands. There was no CSS involved as it was pure HTML. It looked horrible, AF. Anyway, if you want to see it, <a href='old/index.html'>here you go.</a> I don't want to go back to that phase since I’ve learned CSS. My HTML code will never be the same again without it. Fun fact: the titles Escape Route and The Mirrorball for this website and the first one I made came from songs. "Escape Route" is a song by Paramore with the same title, and "Mirrorball" is from Arctic Monkeys' "There’d Better Be a Mirrorball".</p>
            <p><h2>Things about myself.</h2>I'm originally from Sampaloc, Manila, now currently living in San Nicolas, Gapan City. I’m a gamer. I’ve played and am currently playing a lot of games, from my PC to PS2. My favorite bands are : <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/74XFHRwlV6OrjEM0A2NCMF" target="_blank">Paramore</a>, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/7Ln80lUS6He07XvHI8qqHH" target="_blank">Arctic Monkeys</a>, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/0XNa1vTidXlvJ2gHSsRi4A" target="_blank">Franz Ferdinand</a>, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/0epOFNiUfyON9EYx7Tpr6V" target="_blank">The Strokes</a>, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/3yY2gUcIsjMr8hjo51PoJ8" target="_blank">The Smiths</a>, and <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/3AA28KZvwAUcZuOKwyblJQ" target="_blank">Gorillaz</a>.  I listen to them every single second. I sucked at CC-102, I’m decent at IT WS, and surprisingly, I did great at IT NET, as it exceeded my expectations by 1%.</p>
            <p>This is somewhat the "improved" version of my first website but with more style! Get it? HAHAHA.</p>
